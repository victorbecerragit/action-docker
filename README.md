# action-docker

This repository demonstrates automated Docker image building and publishing to Docker Hub using GitHub Actions.

## Overview

The project contains multiple containerized services related to Kubernetes authentication and authorization, with automated CI/CD pipelines that build and push Docker images on every push to the `main` branch.

## What This Project Does

### GitHub Actions Automation

A GitHub Actions workflow (`.github/workflows/docker-image.yml`) automatically:

1. **Triggers on code push** to the `main` branch
2. **Sets up Docker Buildx** for multi-platform builds
3. **Authenticates with Docker Hub** using encrypted credentials
4. **Caches Docker layers** to optimize build times
5. **Builds and pushes 6 Docker images** to Docker Hub:
   - `dind` - Docker-in-Docker environment with additional commands
   - `authn-webhook` - Kubernetes authentication webhook service
   - `authz-webhook` - Kubernetes authorization webhook service
   - `directpv-discover` - DirectPV discovery tool
   - `serp-api-python` - Python SERP API service image
   - `serp-api-go` - Go SERP API service image

### Project Components

- **authn-webhook**: A simple HTTP server implementing Kubernetes token-based authentication webhook for the kube-apiserver
- **authz-webhook**: A simple HTTP server implementing Kubernetes authorization webhook for the kube-apiserver
- **dind**: Docker-in-Docker container with extended functionality
- **kubectl-directpv**: DirectPV discovery service for Kubernetes persistent volumes
- **serp-api**: Python-based SERP API service
- **serp-api/go-serp**: Go-based SERP API service

## How It Works

When you push to `main`:
1. GitHub Actions automatically triggers the workflow
2. Docker images are built using the Dockerfile in each service directory
3. Images are tagged with either fixed versions or `latest`, depending on the service
4. All images are pushed to Docker Hub at `victorbecerra/[service-name]`
5. Build layers are cached to speed up subsequent builds

## Learning Context

These components are based on exercises from "Programming with Kubernetes" (educative.io) and demonstrate webhook implementations for Kubernetes API server authentication and authorization flows.
